# WSL Dev Local Hosts

Scripts to automatically add folders to local hosts file for dns. Resolved issues with Acrylic DNS and WSL2 on port 53.

You can run the scripts from either Windows or the WSL environment:

Running from Windows will escalate the script and request administrator privileges

```

Running from Linux will run the PowerShell script
